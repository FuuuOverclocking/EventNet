Usage:
   路 'gulp build [-t] [-e <ext>]'  - Build EventNet from sources.
      路 -e <ext>  - The entry will be 'src/entry.ts' or
                    'src/entry.<ext>.ts' if <ext> is specified.
      路 -t        - Build the declaration files only.
   路 'gulp clean [-t] [-e <ext>]'  - Clean the build directory.

The build process of EventNet:
  1. The source code will first be compiled into JavaScript (ESM)
     with SourceMap by TypeScript compiler.
  2. The JS files are packaged into a bundle by Rollup,
     and unused functions are removed through tree-shaking.
